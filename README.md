# RSS-scraper

Web scraper that gets articles of your choice from multiple news feeds .Just specify which topics
you are interested in and voila! No need to spend hours surfing the web looking through infinite websites.

## About

The rss-scraper is a dynamic and powerful web scraper that allows you to search for stories based
on select keywords of your choice .It can scrape data simultaneously from multiple news web sites (currently 17) as long as they have an RSS feed (which most major outlets have)

RSS (real simple syndication) is a standard hence most rss sites conform to a set tags convention.
This RSS scraper takes advantage of this feature and is intentionally very configurable,hence this scraper can be expanded exponentially to include multiple and more relevant sources as you wish.
Output is also stored in an easy to access text file in lib/result.txt
